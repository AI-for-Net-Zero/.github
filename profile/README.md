## About us

We are a research group made up of four UK universities. Our work focusses on developing and integrating digital twins into wind, transport, and hydrogen safety to optimise efficiencies in these sectors. By improving the efficiencies in these fields, it will help the UK to achieve its net zero aims.

Here you can find code bases for different aspects of the project. Each of the repositories have descriptions and instructions on how to use the codes.
